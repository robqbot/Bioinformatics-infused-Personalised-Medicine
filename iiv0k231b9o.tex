Consider this, a peaceful Sunday, you and your best mates plans for a great day out, bath on the beach, peddle the blue sparking water and ride the uncontained waves; weather is warm and beautiful, sun is as shiny, you are all enjoying the day as time pass-by, you feel life can not be better than this. Suddenly, a sharp scream ratters the sky, as you are searching for the source, you see Michael, your friend, is rushing towards you, waving and shouting "Call 000, Ben needs help". As you jump up from your cosy beach chair, you see Ben is just dragged up by two guys and start to walking towards you, you searches for your mobile and dial 000. You are prompted to select ambulance service and confirm to send your GPS location, now you speak to one operator, by now you start to feel the adrenaline rush and you notice your voice is shaky. Just as you find difficult to complete a sentence, the operator asks whether Ben suffers heat attach and shows the symptoms of drowning. By now Ben is carried by mates and just stops in front of you under the beach umbrella, you walk towards Ben and you can see Ben is lack of movement and unconscious, you reply "yes" to the operator and you are assured an ambulance is dispatched 5 mins ago and is currently 2 mins away from the scene,
